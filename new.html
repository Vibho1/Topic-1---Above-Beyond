                <br>
                <h6>Here I am providing the summary of the 3 activities that I performed with my team in the class</h6>
                <br>
                <h5><strong>Activity 1 - IoT Apps</strong></h5>
                <p>In this group activity, we were randomly allotted a 6 member team and we had to answer 3 questions
                    related to IoT Apps. First
                    we described what is an IoT Application, we mentioned 3 points explaining this term. Basically, IoT
                    Application
                    exchanges data with other devices
                    over internet and other communication networks. Secondly, we covered some of the essential features
                    of an Iot App
                    , some of which are Securtiy, Scalability,
                    Connectivity, etc., We then went on to give examples of sectors in which there is usage of IoT, it
                    includes modern
                    day security systems, smart wearables,
                    parking systems and many more.</p>
                <br>
                <h5><strong>Activity 2 - Smart Building</strong></h5>

                <p>In this group activity, we briefly explained about a smart building while answering the 3 questions
                    thrown towards us by the faculty.
                    We started with explaining the meaning of the term 'Smart', this means Self- monitoring Analysis and
                    reporting
                    technology which are made
                    intelligent with advanced compute to make our everyday life easy which can include AI and machine
                    learning. We
                    explained the basic functionalities of the
                    'Smart building' which include having measurement sensors, predictive maintenance, remote
                    controlling features and
                    much more. Atlast, light was put on to
                    the detailed scenarios of the smart building.</p>

                <br>
                <h5><strong>Activity 3 - Control Interface</strong></h5>
                <p>In this group activity, we gave information on 'Control Interface'. We started by answering that what
                    are high level features, these refer to
                    those features which are quite complex and require extensive hardware and software. These include
                    features like
                    temperature controlling, smart doors,
                    convenient UI, etc., there was also a discussion about the parts needed for control interface, some
                    of the
                    important parts were IoT sensors and actuators,
                    microcontrollers and microprocessors, analytics and database software. The users of the 'Control
                    Interface were
                    broadly divided into 2 main categories -
                    Registered and Unregistered.</p>

                                Food is an integral part of life without which we cannot survive. However, it is an
                                unfortunate fact that a lot
                                of food is wasted in developed countries
                                like America while people starve in poorer countries like Chad, Sudan, etc. One way to
                                feed everyone is better
                                agricultural practices which can be enhanced
                                using IoT. This can be done by first collecting data for a farm such as soil quality,
                                sunlight levels, seed
                                type, rainfall density from various sources like
                                farm sensors, satellites, local weather stations, etc. and then using this data with
                                Machine Learning and IoT to
                                create custom recommendations for each
                                farm that will optimize the planting procedure, irrigation levels required, fertilizer
                                amount, etc. All this
                                will result in better yield or crops with a
                                focus on reducing world hunger in the future. This is done very efficiently by
                                SunCulture, which is an
                                initiative by Microsoft AI for Earth.

                                Smart vehicles or self-driving cars as they can be called are pretty dependent on IoT.
                                These cars have a lot of
                                features that are integrated with each
                                other and need to communicate such as the sensors that handle navigation, various
                                antennas, controls for
                                speeding or slowing down, etc. Here the Internet
                                of Things technology is critical especially in the sense that self-driving cars need to
                                be extremely accurate
                                and all the parts need to communicate with
                                each other in milliseconds on the road. Tesla Cars are quite popular and working on
                                their self-driving cars.
                                Tesla Motor's cars use the latest advancements
                                in Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. And they are quite popular as
                                well!!! Tesla Model 3 was
                                the most sold plug-in electric car in the
                                U.S. in 2018 with a total yearly sales of around 140,000 cars.

                                Maybe the most famous application of IoT is in Smart Homes. After all, who hasn’t heard
                                about connecting all
                                the home applications like lighting, air

                                your smartphone! These
                                IoT devices are becoming more and more popular
                                these days because they allow you complete freedom to personalize your home as you want.
                                In fact, these IoT
                                devices are so popular that every second there are
                                127 new devices connected to the internet. Some popular ones that you might have heard
                                have, or even have in
                                your home, include Google Home, Amazon Echo Plus,

                                IBM’s Green Horizons initiative is utilizing the Internet of Things and artificial
                                intelligence in order to predict pollution levels and ultimately, drastically lower
                                pollutants. The numerous factors that contribute to air-pollution levels (traffic
                                levels, weather, humidity, wind patterns, etc.) are ingested by connected sensors all
                                over China’s capital, and then broken down by artificial intelligence systems.

                                While the data is too complex for human analysts to be able to detect patterns, AI and
                                IoT technologies are able to digest big data in order to pinpoint trends. After
                                conducting predictive analysis, the system is able to make forecasts far more
                                effectively than ever before. Since launching the initiative in 2014, IBM has been able
                                to generate high-resolution 1-by-1-kilometer pollution forecasts 72 hours in advance,
                                giving citizens more warning and planning time.
